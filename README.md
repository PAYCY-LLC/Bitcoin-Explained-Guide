## 1. About Bitcoin

Over the last few years Bitcoin got labelled in many different ways ranging from electronic cash to the digital gold.

While Bitcoin may be defined in many different ways depending on who you ask, it holds certain unversal properties which in the eyes of many make the Bitcoin "valuable" and consequently regarded as a better alternative to the traditional money like USD or EUR (aka fiat money) or other classical hard assets such as gold or silver.

The idea of Bitcoin was first proposed by someone calling himself Satoshi Nakamoto (not a real name) back in 2008. If interested it can be found here, https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf 

As this guidebook is aimed at non-technical people we won't be going into details here. The paper puts focus on ability to transact with anyone in a safe manner without the need for a third-party intermediary (such as banks in traditional monetary system).

<img src="/images/p2p-vs-centrlized.jpg">

Consequently, the paper proposes Bitcoin, in a form of independent network that is:

- not reliant upon any central entity to work
- functions 24/7 without dependence on a single entity
- ensures equal and fair rules for all participants
- unconditionally open for anyone to join

The ideas brought forward by the author require a fairly solid understanding of present day monetary system and extensive knowledge of Mathematics, Cryptography and Computer Science. Therefore, Bitcoin should be regarded as a major scientific discovery that challenges the status quo of present day monetary systems and enitites surrounding them.


**How Bitcoin Network Works**

The sketch below illustrates how the Bitcoin network looks. Essentially, there are two types of parties participating on the network: wallets and nodes (also known as miners). 

<img src="/images/network-btc.jpg">

1. Wallets are usually represented by Bitcoin users which send and receive payments. Depending on the wallet, it may communicate with any entity on the Bitcoin network directly or may require a middle-man through which it can send/receive payments.

2. Nodes are the entitites which process network transactions and more importantly keep entire history of transactions. A node can also act like a wallet at the same time.


Anyone is able to becaome a member of the network as a node or as a wallet, and start transacting with Bitcoins on equal terms as everyone else.


While every network participant able to send/receive Bitcoin payments, some network members (that Nodes) also keep the entiry history of transactions from the very first one to the last transaction happening now. That history of transactions is what everyone calls a Bitcoin blockchain.

Nodes are tasked with validating every new transaction and ensure that only valid transactions are made to the blockchain. Anyone can setup a full node at home (will be covered later), as long as there is an internet connnection it can autonomously run on old computers. 

If one of the nodes tries to cheat by marking an invalid transaction as valid it would be disregarded by all other nodes on the network. In essence, nodes guarantee the openness, decentralization and security of the network.


**Bitcoin Network in Numbers**

There can exists at most 21 million Bitcoins with over 17 million Bitcoins already being in the market. The remaining part will be created by the network over the course of 130 years in manner described below.

The system designed in a way where a certain number of Bitcoin added to the system roughly every 10 minutes. Those newly created Bitcoins are given away "randomly" to one of the parties. The process is not really random.... but for the sake of keeping things simple all you should understand is that a certain known number of Bitcoins are awarded to one of the network nodes every 10 minutes. The award goes to the node that is first to succesfully solve a mathematical problem. While all nodes are trying to solve it only the very first one gets the prize.

Once the total Bitcoin count reaches 21 million noew new Bitcoins will be issued to the winning node. 

In conclusion, here are the essentials points you should know:

- 21 million: total number of Bitcoins that can exist
- slighly over 17.8 million has already been created by system since 2008
- the remaining 3.2 million will be created over the next 130 years
- about 4 million of those that were already created have been lost (source: fortune.com)[https://fortune.com/2017/11/25/lost-bitcoins/]

Taking into the account above, keep in mind that while there can be 21 million Bitcoins in total the current market supply of Bitcoins is about 14 million Bitcoins.

## 2. Why Bitcoin

Bitcoin started as an idea, which initially was worthless at first without anyone knowing about it. At first it might have attracted hard core enthusiasts which probably played with it for fun. Back then Bitcoin was pereceived mostly as "fun money by geeks" rather than a phenomena that's going to overturn the Financial system. Only few understood that. More people understand that now but the number of such people is still extremely low as mainstream media plays a strong role in shaping how the masses perceive Bitcoin.

Back in early days, the idea that in 10 years Bitcoin would be worth over $10,000 appeared somewhat unbelieveable to early adopters with some spending about 10,000 BTC to buy (Papa John's pizza)[https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.msg1195#msg1195]. 

[bitcoin growth graph, covering entire period]

Growing from 0$ to 100$ was the biggest challenge for Bitcoin had and that first happened sometime in 2013 (nearly 5 years after it emerged)... As time gone buy, it grew higher and higher. It broke $1,000 next year in 2014 though retreated quickly, and reached nearly $20,000 in the end of 2018. 

Understandably Bitcoin was (extremely volatile in its early days)[https://cointelegraph.com/news/a-dazzling-history-of-bitcoins-ups-and-downs]. The volatility was due to low number of people willing to buy/sell the Bitcoin so the price swings were huge back then. Even today, with Bitcoin having a 200 billion market cap it's not uncommon to see a daily price change of 10%. 

Bitcoin today is very different from what it was 10 years ago. While media still plays a huge role in how people pervceive the Bitcoin, they are loosing the battle. Today, all mainstream financial channels, talk about it. And not just media, the kings of financial world as well as world leaders are all talkign about it. While for the most part they try to demean it, they are loosing the battle

## 4. Storing Bitcoin Safely

Bitcoins are usually stored in Bitcoin wallets which can be installed as a mobile app, a desktop program, a website or even a small hardware gadget.

Regardless of the wallet type there is just one crucial point you should look for when choosing a wallet. That is whether the wallet lets you fully control the funds the wallet holds or not.


**Understanding the "Private Key"**

Bitcoin (and most of other crypto) don't have usual accounts/passwords. Instead you get something usually referred as the “Private Key”. You get that key when setting a new wallet app/program for the first time. This key generated randomly so no one can ever guess it. Not even the most powerful computer in the world even if it runs for decades.

The wallet you should be using is the one that allows you (and only you) to see the "Private Key".

Most wallets out there DO NOT provide that capability, even those coming from known exchanges such as Coinbase. What that really means is that funds on the user's wallet balance are in practice are controlled by the entity providing the wallet. In practice, that means the user's access to the wallet can be restricted at any time and funds on the waller can be frozen. It also means that if the infrustrcture/servers powering that wallet is compromised the users' funds can be stollen. 

All of the risks mentioned are fairly common with a lof of Bitcoins were and being stollen this way.  It's more common than you may think! Due to unregulated nature of this space, wallet users are unlikely to be compensate for the losses

On the other hand, when the wallet provider gives its user exclusive control over the Private Key, the full control is delegated to the user. In practice that would mean that no one but the wallet user has control over the funds. 

The risk here is that you may loose the key or expose it to someone who can then reenter that key in some other wallet and get control of your Bitcoins.


**"Private Key" is Everything**

The “Private Key” usually shown to user in a form of 12 plain English words. Sometimes it can be more than 12. Those 12 plain words is just a ”human readable” representation of that key.

[secret_key_image]


Safely storing that “Private Key” is extremely important. Let's say you transferred some bitcoins to your new wallet app. Even if your phone stops working or the wallet app stops working your funds are still safe. You will always be able to restore access to your bitcoins using that “Private Key”. It can be even years later, in the same app or some other wallet app/program.

Treat the “Private Key” wallet app gives you with great care. If someone ever sees it, your funds are in danger because that person can essentially download same or some other wallet app and get access to you funds using that key. You have to ensure they Secret Key for the wallet is kept somewhere safe.


**What If Your Phone Is Lost**

Let's say you lost your phone and someone finds it. If the phone doesn't have the Android/iOS PIN lock in place, the person who found your phone may potentially access (hack into) the wallet app and from there essentially become in possession of that “Private Key” controlling your funds. That person may then spend your bitcoins by sending them to his/her address.

On the other hand, if your has OS PIN in place it would extremely difficult for someone to hack into it. You will have enough time to get a new phone or simply download some new wallet app to your computer and use the 'Restore' option which most apps have to get access to your funds.

[restore_wallet_screens]

Using that Reastore option you will are able to restore access your funds and then move your funds to a new wallet (ideally within the same app). Once you have moved your funds, even if the intruder manages to break into your wallet (that was on the old phone) it will be useless as it won't have any money on it. The new wallet will come with its own "Private Key".

That’s the only thing you should really understand. The rest is secondary.


**Keeping Bitcoins on Exchange**

As mentioned above the most popular and pretty much the only practical (and somewhat safer) way to purchase Bitcoins is by using crypto exchanges. There is no shortage of them around.

Depending on the amount of Bitcoins you're looking to buy in most cases the process will be somewwat similar to the steps outlined below:

For smaller amounts (below < $1000):

This is the easiest option and for which you will bascially need only a credit card. You will be able to purhase Bitcoin and other crypto using your credit card. This option is convenient but bear in mind that you will be prurchasing the crypto at slightly higher prices than market rates.

- credit card option 1
- credit card option 2
- credit card option 3


For larger amounts (above > $1000):

If you're looking to invest substantial amount of money then the only safe option for a new user is buying on crypto exchange. That may sounds a bit complicated for someone who never traded stocks or currencies but it's not difficult at all.

Most exchanges are same as pretty much all have to abide by financial regulations and therefore have certain rules in place. The steps of purchasing the Bitcoins on Exchange is generally as follows:

1. setup an account
2. verify account (usually it would ask for a passport scan)
3. fund exchange account (via credit card or bank transfer)
4. purchase Bitcoin (or other crypto)
5. transfer purchased Bitcoin to your wallet for safekeeping

A lot of people prefer keeping the purchased Bitcoins on the exchange itself. Many mistakenly assume that keeping them on exchanges is safe while it's not. Just like wallets exchanges are hacked and when that happens usually users loose their funds without getting compensated.

- exhcnage hack link 4

If you keep bitcoins on exchange, it means the exchange keeps them for you on their account. They give you username and password so that you can send them instructions like withdrawing/depositing bitcoins.

The risk here is for exchange to get hacked or for them to scam everyone by telling that they were hacked. They also can freeze/restrict your account for whatever reason. All of the risks mentioned are fairly common.

If someone somehow gets hold of your username/password to access the exchange you will loose your funds because the attacker will withdraw Bitcoins elsewhere. Note that some senior level administrators on the exchange probably have full access to your account. 

The point I am trying to make you kind of have to trust them not to be evil :)


## 5. Transacting with Bitcoin: Sending / Receive 

Nearly every Bitcoin wallet comes with Send and Receive features.

The Send feature deducts amount the SECRET KEY can spend by passing the ownership for that amount to a new owner. The Receive feature allows someone to bitcoins from other people.

Once certain amount of bitcoins are sent to another address, the ownership is transferred to the owner of the destination address. From that moment onwards, only the owner of the destination address can send/transfer/spend those Bitcoins.

**Sending Bitcoins**

To send someone Bitcoin you simply need to ask the recipient for his/her address and then use the wallet where you have bitcoin to send the desired amount to the provided address.

[send_form_image]

**Receiving Bitcoins**

To receive Bitcoins from someone or to transfer bitcoins from exchange account to your wallet account, you simply need to grab your Receive address from the wallet app you'are using and provide that address to the sender.

It should be noted, that most well-designed wallets will provide you a new "receive address" for each transaction. This is a privacy feature enabled in each wallet to keep you somewhat anonymous (explained below).

**Bitcoin Transactions**

At first transaction sent from sender's wallet to the network. At the end of this step most (usually > 99%) miners/nodes that store blockchain and process transactions have the transaction in something called as "mempool". This whole process usually takes a couple seconds. In practice, that would mean that when you send transaction the recipient will see it PENDING in his/her wallet within a couple seconds. 

It should be also noted that this would be the case if the wallet you're using is a decentralized one (i.e. talks directly to a blockchain rather than through a middle man).

When the transaction reaches every miner/node it's not yet part of the blockchain. The transaction becomes confirmed and no longer pending when it's included in the block. In Bitcoin blockchain the block closed roughly every 10 minutes, it varies for other blockchains.


- Unlike regular money Bitcoin transactions are final and non-reversible. Once they are sent it's impossible to revert them. After the transaction is included in the block it can be already considered as completed. However, there is a general consensus for the transaction to be considered as FINAL (irreversible) 6 more blocks has to pass after the transaction was included in the block. This will add roughly another 50 minutes. 

It's potentially possible to cancel transaction while it remains in pending state but for the sake of keeping this guide simple it won't be covered here. The general rule of thumbs once you see that transaction has been included in the block it's fairly safe to consider it final. 

- trnasaction duration: ... (provide links to block explorers)

- Bitcoin transactions are semi anonymous: ....

**Bitcoin transaction fees explained**

There are some factors which may affect the duration of this step. The main factor is the fee sender used when sending the transaction. If the fee is low and the mempool was crowded when transaction was sent it will take longer. More precisely, it will be confirmed when the mempool gets less crowded. In most cases it will happen within 24 hours.

If the fee was sufficient then it will most likely be confirmed within 10 minutes. So, that's why setting the fee properly is important, especially for large payments that need to happen quickly.

Some of the wallets that have the fee estimation/recommendations capabilities are bread wallet (https://brd.com), unstoppable wallet (https://unstoppable.money)

After the transaction is included in the block it can be already considered as completed.
