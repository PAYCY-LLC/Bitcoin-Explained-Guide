## 1. About Bitcoin

Over the last few years Bitcoin got labeled in many different ways, from electronic cash to the digital gold.

While Bitcoin may be defined in many different ways depending on who you ask, it holds certain universal properties which in the eyes of many make the Bitcoin "valuable" and consequently regarded as a better alternative to the traditional money like USD or EUR (aka fiat money) or other classical hard assets such as gold or silver.

The idea of Bitcoin was first proposed by someone calling himself Satoshi Nakamoto (not a real name) back in 2008. If interested Satoshi's paper can be found [here](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). The paper puts focus on ability to transact with anyone in a safe manner without the need for a 3'rd party intermediary (such as banks).

The images below demonstrate the difference between a centralized network (i.e. traditional monetary system) vs a Bitcoin network or a similar decentralized network.

*Centralized Network*

<img src="/images/image_banks.png" align="center">

*Decentralized Network*

<img src="/images/image_blockchains.png">


Satoshi Nakamoto proposed a Bitcoin, in a form of decentralized network that is:

- not reliant upon any central entity to remain online
- functional 24 hours/day without dependence on any entity
- has equal rules for all network participants
- unconditionally open for anyone to join
- works without geographical borders


> Note: The ideas brought forward in the paper required a fairly comprehensive understanding of the contemporary monetary system and extensive knowledge of Mathematics, Cryptography and Computer Science. 
>
> Therefore, Bitcoin should be regarded as a scientific invention that potentially challenges the status quo of present day monetary system and regulatory entities surrounding them.


**How Bitcoin Network Works**

Usually, when someone talks about Bitcoin blockchain or Bitcoin users the person refers to the Bitcoin network.

The sketch below illustrates the basic structure of Bitcoin network. In essence, there are two types of parties participating on the network: wallets and nodes (aka miners).

<img src="/images/image_net.png">

Anyone is able to join the network as a node or a wallet, and start transacting with Bitcoins on equal terms as everyone else.

1. Wallets are usually represented by Bitcoin users which send and receive payments. Depending on the wallet type, it may communicate with any entity on the Bitcoin network directly or may require a middle-man through which it can send/receive payments.

2. Nodes are the entities which process network transactions and more importantly keep history of transactions. A node can also act like a wallet at the same time.

While every network participant is able to send/receive Bitcoin payments, some network members (Nodes) also keep the entity history of transactions from the very first one to the transactions happening now. That entire history of transactions is what is called a Bitcoin blockchain. The word blockchain originates from the fact that new transactions are added to history in batches (i.e. a block of transactions), roughly once every 10 minutes.

Nodes are also tasked with validating every new transaction and ensure that only valid transactions are made to the blockchain. Anyone can setup a node at home (will be covered later), as long as there is a working Internet connection it can autonomously operate even on an old computer. 

If one of the nodes tries to cheat the network by marking an invalid transaction as valid it would be disregarded by all other nodes on the network. In essence, cumulatively nodes guarantee the openness, availability, decentralization and security of the network. Cheating on such network in practical terms is close impossible.

There are close to 9000 Bitcoin nodes powering the network at any given time (source: [https://bitnodes.earn.com](https://bitnodes.earn.com/)). The nodes are spread throughout the world, covering all continents and most of the countries worldwide.

<img src="/images/bitcoin-nodes-global.png">

As mentioned earlier anyone can setup a Bitcoin node at home and act as a guardian of the Bitcoin network.


**Bitcoin in Numbers**

There will be in total 21 million Bitcoins with over 17 million Bitcoins have been released to the market. The remaining part will be created by the Bitcoin network over the course of 130 years in a manner described below.

The system designed in a way where a certain number of Bitcoins are added to the network roughly every 10 minutes. Those newly created Bitcoins are given away "randomly" to one of the parties. The process is not really random.... but for the sake of keeping things simple, all you should understand is that a certain amount (publicly known) of Bitcoins are awarded to one of the network nodes every 10 minutes. The award goes to the node that is the first to successfully solve a mathematical problem. While all nodes are trying to solve it only the very first one gets the prize.

> Note: The release of new Bitcoins to the circulation is not something that's controlled by some entity. It's a fully automated process and been regulated autonomously by a network, based on the instructions that were put in the code powering Bitcoin network back in 2009.

Once the total Bitcoin count reaches 21 million no new Bitcoins will be awarded to the winning node.

In conclusion:

- 21 million: total number of Bitcoins that can exist
- over 17.8 million have already been created by network since 2008
- the remaining 3.2 million will be created over the next 130 years
- about 4 million Bitcoins have been already lost (source: [fortune.com](https://fortune.com/2017/11/25/lost-bitcoins/))

Taking into the Bitcoins that were lost, we can conclude that out of 17.8 million Bitcoins only about 14 millions are available on the market at this point. 

> Note: A single Bitcoin consists of 100 million (100,000,000) units called Satoshi.

**Bitcoin Forks and Other Cryptocurrencies**

When trying to understand the Bitcoin for the first time a lot of people are usually left confused and frustrated...

First the person tries to understand the Bitcoin and what's the big deal about it. Then while digging through they discover other cryptocurrencies with most trying hard to portray itself as a better alternative to Bitcoin. There are also a handful of cryptocurrencies which have "Bitcoin" in its name. All these aspects make the onboarding experience for the new users extremely difficult. 

While it may seem like a lot to digest, the essential points can be summarized as:

- Bitcoin: While there are a number of currencies with Bitcoin in the name the one that's considered the original Bitcoin is the one with the symbol BTC. Sometimes it's also called as the Bitcoin Core.

- Bitcoin forks: Refer to cryptocurrencies which were derived from the original Bitcoin (BTC). Due to the open source nature of Bitcoin and underlying code anyone is able to create a Bitcoin like cryptocurrency with some modifications and market it as a separate cryptocurrency. The most noteworthy such cryptocurrency is [Bitcoin Cash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_Cash)

- Altcoins: Usually the term refers to all other cryptocurrencies that are around. While there are thousands of them around only few managed to attract the audience and gain some crypto market share. The altcoins which have not attracted any audience are generally regarded as coins with no value proposition and are labeled as "shitcoins".

For the comprehensive list as well as current market prices of cryptocurrencies see [CoinMarketCap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com).

## 2. Why Bitcoin

Bitcoin started as an idea, which initially was worthless as only a handful of people knew about it. Back then the Bitcoin was mostly perceived as a "fun money for geeks" rather than a phenomena that can potentially challenge and overturn the present-day financial system. Only few understood that... Although a lot more more people understand that now, the number of such people is still relatively low. This is mainly due to the fact that mainstream media have played a strong role in shaping how the masses perceive Bitcoin. Nearly all early mainstream [media mentions of Bitcoin](https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-mainstream-media/) were negative. The Bitcoin was [declared dead](https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-obituaries/) about 400 times by now.

Back in early days, the idea that someday Bitcoin would be worth over $10,000 appeared somewhat unbelievable...  With [some](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.msg1195#msg1195) spending 10,000 BTC (over 100,000,000 USD today) to buy pizza :)

Fast forward to August 2019, Bitcoin was mostly traded over the $11,000 mark. It seems to have consolidated above the $10,000 mark at this point.

> Regardless of the current price, the biggest challenge for the Bitcoin was to grow from 0$ to 100$ and that first happened sometime in 2013 (nearly 5 years after it emerged)... As time gone buy, it grew higher and higher. It broke $1,000 next year in 2014 though retreated quickly, and even reached nearly $20,000 in the end of 2018. But the hardest point was to break away from 0$ mark and raise above the 100$.

Understandably Bitcoin was and still is extremely volatile. The volatility is primarily due to low number of people willing to buy/sell the Bitcoin at any given time. Today Bitcoin has a 200 billion market cap it's still not uncommon to see a daily price change of 5%. The market cap should reach a couple of trillions before public hype/panic/traders would be unable to affect the price significantly.

Bitcoin today is very different from what it was 10 years ago. While media still plays a huge role in how people perceive the Bitcoin, they seem to be loosing the battle as the price seem to be going up... These days, nearly all mainstream financial channels regularly talk about Bitcoin. And not just media, the kings of the financial world as well as [the world leaders](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1149472282584072192) are all taking notice.

- [14 Bitcoin quotes by famous people](https://medium.com/@MartinRosulek/14-bitcoin-quotes-by-famous-people-6e7a1a009281)

It's no longer perceived as "fun money for geeks" but more as a "valuable financial asset" with a growing appeal. The current market price as well as the market capitalization of Bitcoin is an indication of that.


**Why Bitcoin Keeps Growing?**

To understand what drives Bitcoin price higher and further adoption it's important to look at Bitcoin as a social cause. A cause that seeks to provide a solution to some major socio-economic problems rather than some new asset class or even an alternative to gold or fiat money.

> Bitcoin is not an improvement to how we transact and preserve wealth.
> It's a whole new way to own and control wealth.

Unlike traditional assets and financial instruments which are generally enforced by governments or some other centralized organizations, the core driving force of the Bitcoin is a global community. These people are driven by liberating ideas and share a strong passion to convey these ideas to the world.

Some of the main principles at the core of these ideas are:


- Financial system must be decentralized and temper-proof

- Financial system must be unconditionally open for all

- Participants must have unconditional control over personal assets

- The underlying asset powering the value transfer should be scarce


A growing number of people are gradually moving towards embracing Bitcoin in face of modern day problems such as for-profit wars, widespread poverty, excessive money printing and politically-motivated sanctioning. This trend is likely to continue ... over the long term Bitcoin will grow. Those that understand this are trying to accumulate the Bitcoin reserves now.

**Can The Bitcoin Be Stopped?**

A lot of new people entering Bitcoin ecosystem remain somewhat skeptical about its ability to succeed. The narrative that one day a Bitcoin or alike decentralized system may replace the centrally regulated financial systems seem unbelievable. A narrative that one day governments will try to ban/outlaw the Bitcoin seem more likely, especially for those who are unaware about how Bitcoin operates on a technical level.

So, the real question is can the government or anyone else for that matter stop the Bitcoin? The answer is NO. 

Should any entity try to outlaw Bitcoin enforcing such ban would be practically impossible. As long as there is electricity powering your computers or phones the Bitcoin network can exist and flourish. They can surely make it more difficult for people to participate in the network but that's pretty much it.

What you should understand taking down Bitcoin is significantly more difficult then taking down the entire Internet. While modern day governments/regulators are able to effectively censor what is being seen on search engines, YouTube or mainstream media, censoring people from being able to participate in Bitcoin network is a whole new level.

- [Rep. Patrick McHenry: 'There's no capacity to kill Bitcoin'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xolYGw2wU6Y)
- [U.S. Lawmakers Are Realizing They Can’t Ban Bitcoin](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ktorpey/2019/07/30/us-lawmakers-are-realizing-they-cant-ban-bitcoin/)
- [Unstoppable Code: The Difference Between Can't and Won't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6euy5W1js4&app=desktop)
- [Blockstream Satellite: Broadcasting Bitcoin from Space](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/blockstream-satellite-broadcasting-bitcoin-space)

The only way for the Bitcoin network to stop having any meaningful value is for everyone to stop using it. Such an outcome is likely to occur only if someone discovers an unrepairable fundamental flaw in the code powering the network. Other than that any measure to outlaw the Bitcoin would lack the substance needed to enforce it. 


## 3. Buying Bitcoin

If you made until this point you should already have a general idea of what Bitcoin is. The next step for us is to introduce to buying Bitcoin so that you can own some.

<img src="/images/buy-bitcoin-online.jpg">

At [current](https://www.coinbase.com/price/bitcoin) prices, buying even just one Bitcoin would set you back as much as $10,000 or even more. The good news, you don't have to and perhaps should not spend $10,000 to get started. Start small and buy only $100 worth of Bitcoin at first. Later once you're comfortable with all aspects of owning Bitcoin you may buy more and increase your holdings.  

> Disclaimer: 
> 
> Regardless of what the me (the author) or anyone else says about Bitcoin and its future potential, you should understand that there are no guarantees that the price of Bitcoin will grow higher and meet your expectations. A lot of people believe in technology and believe it will get it's place on world stage BUT no one knows what will happen in the future and how the Bitcoin going to evolve. 
>
> Therefore, use your own judgment when contemplating investing in Bitcoin and keep in mind that it may just go down in price and never recover from there. Future is unpredictable and therefore don't spend on this more than you can afford to loose.

There are two main ways for a newcomer to acquire Bitcoin. You can either find someone willing to send you some amount of Bitcoins or you may purchase Bitcoins online.


**Buy Bitcoin online with Credit Card**

At the moment there are plenty of places online where it's possible to buy Bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies using Visa or MasterCard credit cards. 

> Note: While there are a lot places that advertise buying Bitcoin for credit cards not all are safe. For your safety use only resources that you know about. 

Below you will a list of popular places that have already served thousands of people looking to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies using credit cards. While those coming from EU or US have plenty of options to choose for people coming from less developed nations there will be fewer options to choose from. That said, regardless of where you coming from one of the options below should work for you.

- https://cex.io/cards/
- https://payments.changelly.com/
- https://www.coinbase.com/
- https://www.coinmama.com/bitcoin
- https://www.binance.com/en/creditcard
- https://buy.bitcoin.com
- https://indacoin.com
- https://www.bitpanda.com/en/prices/bitcoin


While buying using credit card is somewhat simpler, it works well only if you're looking to buy no more than a couple of thousands worth of Bitcoins. For larger amounts and regular purchases you should be buying using cryptocurrency exchange.


**Buy Bitcoin on Exchange**

Cryptocurrency exchanges are websites where you can buy, sell or exchange one cryptocurrency for another or for traditional currency like US Dollars (USD) or Euro (EUR). There are plenty of good cryptocurrency exchanges around, below are listed those that we have some experience with.


- ShapeShift
https://shapeshift.com

- Binance
Offers mobile app and probably the fastest growing exchange. If you need to pick only one, this is the best and #1 in 2019.

- Coinbase.com
https://www.coinbase.com/

- CEX.io
EUROPEAN BASED.

- etoro.com

- CoinMama: 
Old but gold and let you buy BTC and ETH instantly.


- Changelly: 
Instantly convert any cryptocurrency to any of your choices. Great for instant conversion






## 4. Storing Bitcoin Safely

Bitcoins are usually stored in Bitcoin wallets which can be installed as a mobile app, a desktop program, a website or even a small hardware gadget.

Regardless of the wallet type there is just one crucial point you should look for when choosing a wallet. That is whether the wallet lets you fully control the funds the wallet holds or not.


**Understanding the "Private Key"**

Bitcoin (and most of other crypto) don't have usual accounts/passwords. Instead you get something usually referred as the “Private Key”. You get that key when setting a new wallet app/program for the first time. This key generated randomly so no one can ever guess it. Not even the most powerful computer in the world even if it runs for decades.

The wallet you should be using is the one that allows you (and only you) to see the "Private Key".

Most wallets out there DO NOT provide that capability, even those coming from known exchanges such as Coinbase. What that really means is that funds on the user's wallet balance are in practice are controlled by the entity providing the wallet. In practice, that means the user's access to the wallet can be restricted at any time and funds on the waller can be frozen. It also means that if the infrastructure/servers powering that wallet is compromised the users' funds can be stolen. 

All of the risks mentioned are fairly common with a lot of Bitcoins were and being stolen this way. It's more common than you may think! Due to unregulated nature of this space, wallet users are unlikely to be compensated for the losses

- Cryptocurrency customers are unable to access their coins after Canadian CEO’s death
https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/05/millions-in-cryptocurrencies-frozen-after-quadriga-founders-death.html

On the other hand, when the wallet provider gives its user exclusive control over the Private Key, the full control is delegated to the user. In practice that would mean that no one but the wallet user has control over the funds. 

The risk here is that you may loose the key or expose it to someone who can then reenter that key in some other wallet and get control of your Bitcoins.


**"Private Key" is Everything**

The “Private Key” usually shown to user in a form of 12 plain English words. Sometimes it can be more than 12. Those 12 plain words is just a ”human readable” representation of that key.

[secret_key_image]


Safely storing that “Private Key” is extremely important. Let's say you transferred some Bitcoins to your new wallet app. Even if your phone stops working or the wallet app stops working your funds are still safe. You will always be able to restore access to your Bitcoins using that “Private Key”. It can be even years later, in the same app or some other wallet app/program.

Treat the “Private Key” wallet app gives you with great care. If someone ever sees it, your funds are in danger because that person can essentially download same or some other wallet app and get access to you funds using that key. You have to ensure they Secret Key for the wallet is kept somewhere safe.


**What If Your Phone Is Lost**

Let's say you lost your phone and someone finds it. If the phone doesn't have the Android/iOS PIN lock in place, the person who found your phone may potentially access (hack into) the wallet app and from there essentially become in possession of that “Private Key” controlling your funds. That person may then spend your Bitcoins by sending them to his/her address.

On the other hand, if your has OS PIN in place it would extremely difficult for someone to hack into it. You will have enough time to get a new phone or simply download some new wallet app to your computer and use the 'Restore' option which most apps have to get access to your funds.

[restore_wallet_screens]

Using that Restore option you will are able to restore access your funds and then move your funds to a new wallet (ideally within the same app). Once you have moved your funds, even if the intruder manages to break into your wallet (that was on the old phone) it will be useless as it won't have any money on it. The new wallet will come with its own "Private Key".

That’s the only thing you should really understand. The rest is secondary.

**Keeping Bitcoins on Exchange**

As mentioned above the most popular and pretty much the only practical (and somewhat safer) way to purchase Bitcoins is by using crypto exchanges. There is no shortage of them around.

Depending on the amount of Bitcoins you're looking to buy in most cases the process will be somewhat similar to the steps outlined below:

For smaller amounts (below < $1000):

This is the easiest option and for which you will basically need only a credit card. You will be able to purchase Bitcoin and other crypto using your credit card. This option is convenient but bear in mind that you will be purchasing the crypto at slightly higher prices than market rates.

- credit card option 1
- credit card option 2
- credit card option 3
- coinbase
- crypterium
- nexo


For larger amounts (above > $1000):

If you're looking to invest substantial amount of money then the only safe option for a new user is buying on crypto exchange. That may sounds a bit complicated for someone who never traded stocks or currencies but it's not difficult at all.

Most exchanges are same as pretty much all have to abide by financial regulations and therefore have certain rules in place. The steps of purchasing the Bitcoins on Exchange is generally as follows:

1. setup an account
2. verify account (usually it would ask for a passport scan)
3. fund exchange account (via credit card or bank transfer)
4. purchase Bitcoin (or other crypto)
5. transfer purchased Bitcoin to your wallet for safekeeping

A lot of people prefer keeping the purchased Bitcoins on the exchange itself. Many mistakenly assume that keeping them on exchanges is safe while it's not. Just like wallets exchanges are hacked and when that happens usually users loose their funds without getting compensated.

- Coincheck: the Biggest Crypto Exchange Hack of All Time
https://coin360.com/blog/top-7-crypto-exchange-hacks

- A timeline of major crypto-exchange hacks
https://discover.ledger.com/hackstimeline/

If you keep bitcoins on exchange, it means the exchange keeps them for you on their account. They give you username and password so that you can send them instructions like withdrawing/depositing bitcoins.

The risk here is for exchange to get hacked or for them to scam everyone by telling that they were hacked. They also can freeze/restrict your account for whatever reason. All of the risks mentioned are fairly common.

If someone somehow gets hold of your username/password to access the exchange you will loose your funds because the attacker will withdraw Bitcoins elsewhere. Note that some senior level administrators on the exchange potentially do have full access to your account funds.

The point I am trying to make you kind of have to trust them not to be evil :)


## 5. Transacting with Bitcoin: Sending / Receive 

Nearly every Bitcoin wallet comes with Send and Receive features.

The Send feature deducts amount the SECRET KEY can spend by passing the ownership for that amount to a new owner. The Receive feature allows someone to bitcoins from other people.

Once certain amount of bitcoins are sent to another address, the ownership is transferred to the owner of the destination address. From that moment onwards, only the owner of the destination address can send/transfer/spend those Bitcoins.

**Sending Bitcoins**

To send someone Bitcoin you simply need to ask the recipient for his/her address and then use the wallet where you have bitcoin to send the desired amount to the provided address.

[send_form_image]

**Receiving Bitcoins**

To receive Bitcoins from someone or to transfer bitcoins from exchange account to your wallet account, you simply need to grab your Receive address from the wallet app you'are using and provide that address to the sender.

It should be noted, that most well-designed wallets will provide you a new "receive address" for each transaction. This is a privacy feature enabled in each wallet to keep you somewhat anonymous (explained below).

**Bitcoin Transactions**

At first transaction sent from sender's wallet to the network. At the end of this step most (usually > 99%) miners/nodes that store blockchain and process transactions have the transaction in something called as "mempool". This whole process usually takes a couple seconds. In practice, that would mean that when you send transaction the recipient will see it PENDING in his/her wallet within a couple seconds. 

It should be also noted that this would be the case if the wallet you're using is a decentralized one (i.e. talks directly to a blockchain rather than through a middle man).

When the transaction reaches every miner/node it's not yet part of the blockchain. The transaction becomes confirmed and no longer pending when it's included in the block. In Bitcoin blockchain the block closed roughly every 10 minutes, it varies for other blockchains.


- Unlike regular money Bitcoin transactions are final and non-reversible. Once they are sent it's impossible to revert them. After the transaction is included in the block it can be already considered as completed. However, there is a general consensus for the transaction to be considered as FINAL (irreversible) 6 more blocks has to pass after the transaction was included in the block. This will add roughly another 50 minutes. 

It's potentially possible to cancel transaction while it remains in pending state but for the sake of keeping this guide simple it won't be covered here. The general rule of thumbs once you see that transaction has been included in the block it's fairly safe to consider it final. 

- trnasaction duration: ... (provide links to block explorers)

- Bitcoin transactions are semi anonymous: ....

**Bitcoin transaction fees explained**

There are some factors which may affect the duration of this step. The main factor is the fee sender used when sending the transaction. If the fee is low and the mempool was crowded when transaction was sent it will take longer. More precisely, it will be confirmed when the mempool gets less crowded. In most cases it will happen within 24 hours.

If the fee was sufficient then it will most likely be confirmed within 10 minutes. So, that's why setting the fee properly is important, especially for large payments that need to happen quickly.

Some of the wallets that have the fee estimation/recommendations capabilities are bread wallet (https://brd.com), unstoppable wallet (https://unstoppable.money)

After the transaction is included in the block it can be already considered as completed.
